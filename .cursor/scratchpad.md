   - Desktop: 128px â†’ 224px (`w-32` to `xl:w-56`) based on screen size
   - Mobile: Full width but smaller height (h-9 instead of h-12)
   - Shortened placeholder text to "Search..." for better mobile UX

2. **Header Responsiveness**:
   - Brand name scales: `text-lg sm:text-xl lg:text-2xl`
   - Navigation hidden on tablets (`lg:flex` instead of `md:flex`)
   - Responsive padding: `py-4 lg:py-6`
   - Better gap spacing with responsive gaps

3. **Cart Icon Optimization**:
   - Responsive sizing: `h-5 w-5 sm:h-6 sm:w-6`
   - Smaller cart badge on mobile: `w-4 h-4 sm:w-5 sm:h-5`
   - Better padding and spacing

4. **Mobile-First Improvements**:
   - Search input appears on mobile (`md:hidden`) instead of small screens
   - Consistent styling between desktop and mobile search
   - Optimized icon sizes and spacing for touch interfaces

**Result**: Much more balanced and professional navbar that works perfectly across all screen sizes without overwhelming the interface.
